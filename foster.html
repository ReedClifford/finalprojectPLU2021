          Fostering saves lives. The foster home program is the best way to
          rescue an animal. It is also an opportunity for anyone who wants
          animal companionship but cannot commit to adopting.

        <h1>How can I rescue by fostering?</h1>
        <p>
          Often, people come to the shelter to admit a rescued cat or dog, but
          we are forced to turn them away due to lack of space. However, if
          these people agree to foster their rescued animal (or another shelter
          animal), then we are able to free up space and save another life.

          <h1>Who can be a foster parent?</h1>
          <p>
            Even first time pet owners can be foster parents. All we ask is that
            you treat your foster cats or dogs as if they were your own. You
            will also need to review and sign the

          <p>
            Do you have enough room in your house to keep a cat or dog indoors?
            Are you willing to administer medicine to a sick animal, if
            necessary? Will you be able to bring it to the vet when the need
            arises?

            PussyLoversUnited will provide veterinary services for FREE, and if
            possible, some food and medicine as well. However, foster parents
            may need to shoulder some of the costs as there may be shortages at
            times. Please remember that PussyLoversUnited is solely dependent on
            donations.

          <h1>How long is the foster period?</h1>
          <p>
            A foster parent must be prepared to care for their foster pet for at
            least 6 months. This is to ensure that the animal has recovered from
            any sickness, and has been vaccinated. It’s best if they are
            spayed/neutered as well before getting admitted to the shelter.

            Blur will need space for self-discovery, since he is still growing
